# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a complete machine learning workflow using the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, logistic regression modeling, and evaluation â€” all implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

The objective is to predict whether a given passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on available attributes like class, age, gender, fare, and more. This is a binary classification problem.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset used is the classic **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle. Key features include:

* `Pclass`: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
* `Sex`: Gender
* `Age`: Age in years
* `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
* `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
* `Fare`: Passenger fare
* `Embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
* `Survived`: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## ðŸ”§ What We Did (Step-by-Step Breakdown)

### 1. **Importing Libraries**

* Used `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
* `seaborn`, `matplotlib` for data visualization
* `scikit-learn` for machine learning

### 2. **Loading the Data**

* Loaded the dataset from `train.csv`
* Displayed the first few records using `.head()`

### 3. **Initial Exploration**

* Used `.info()` and `.describe()` to understand data types, missing values, and distributions
* Used `.value_counts()` to inspect categorical features like `Sex`, `Embarked`, and `Pclass`

### 4. **Handling Missing Data**

* Filled missing values in `Age` with the median
* Filled missing values in `Embarked` with the mode
* Dropped the `Cabin` column due to a high number of missing entries

### 5. **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**

* Removed `PassengerId`, `Name`, and `Ticket` since they donâ€™t add predictive value

### 6. **Encoding Categorical Variables**

* Converted `Sex` and `Embarked` into numeric form using `.map()`

### 7. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Visualized feature relationships with:

  * `sns.pairplot()` to observe patterns between `Pclass`, `Age`, `Fare`, and `Survived`
  * `sns.heatmap()` for feature correlation
  * Count plots and bar plots to examine survival by gender and class
  * Histograms and boxplots for distribution insights

### 8. **Feature Selection**

* Selected features that were cleaned and numerically encoded
* Defined `X` (features) and `y` (target = `Survived`)

### 9. **Splitting the Data**

* Used `train_test_split()` to divide data into 80% training and 20% test sets

### 10. **Training the Model**

* Used `LogisticRegression()` from scikit-learn
* Fit the model on the training data

### 11. **Making Predictions**

* Predicted survival outcomes on the test set

### 12. **Evaluating the Model**

* Measured accuracy using `accuracy_score`
* Displayed precision, recall, and F1-score using `classification_report`
* Plotted and interpreted the confusion matrix using `sns.heatmap()`

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Visualizations

* **Pairplot**: Showed clear separation trends across classes and fares
* **Correlation heatmap**: Revealed strong relationship between `Pclass`, `Sex`, and `Survived`
* **Survival rates**:

  * Higher survival for females
  * Higher survival in 1st class passengers
* **Boxplots and histograms**: Helped identify outliers and distribution patterns

## âœ… Summary of Findings

* Gender was the most significant predictor: females had a much higher survival rate.
* Class also influenced survival: first-class passengers had the highest chance.
* Fare had a mild correlation â€” passengers who paid more were more likely to survive.
* Age had non-linear patterns, but children had slightly better survival rates.
* Logistic Regression gave good baseline performance, showing clear class separation.
